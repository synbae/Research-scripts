Intro
-----

py3270 is a Python interface to x3270, an IBM 3270 terminal emulator.
It provides an API to a x3270 or s3270 subprocess.

Example
--------

The x3270 executables need to be on your PATH!

A brief example of usage:

.. code:: python

    from py3270 import Emulator

    # use x3270 so you can see what is going on
    em = Emulator(visible=True)

    # or not (uses s3270)
    em = Emulator()

    em.connect('3270host.example.com')
    em.fill_field(17, 23, 'mylogin', 8)
    em.fill_field(18, 23, 'mypass', 8)
    em.send_enter()

    # if your host unlocks the keyboard before truly being ready you can use:
    em.wait_for_field()

    # maybe look for a status message
    if not em.string_found(1, 2, 'login succesful'):
        abort()

    # do something useful

    # disconnect from host and kill subprocess
    em.terminate()

Documentation
--------------

None, sorry. Read the code, its pretty simple & self-explanatory  :)

Current Status
---------------

The interface seems sound, but the Emulator class has only basic functionality.
There are more x3270 commands that the Emulator could have methods for. That
being said, I believe most x3270 functionality can be supported at a lower-level
by the use of Emulator.exec_command().

py3270 is installable via `pip` with ``pip install py3270`` or `easy_install`
with ``easy_install py3270``.
